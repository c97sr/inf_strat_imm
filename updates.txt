Correct the bugs to generate table2. The previous code is wrong. So most of the table2 results are not correct.
Because the index in for loop was wrong.

23062015
Change working project dir from
% E:\working\Projects.IC\Projects\isl\mat\Misltr\isltr-1.4\out\mcmc\ph1n1\20150106
to

table2.m
lower bound and upper bound change from 0.05 to 0.025; 0.95 to 0.975

02032015
Fitting the initial titres

15022015
make initial_prev_Xu_uniform.m (called by make_ics_naive)
initial_naive if make complete naive population.
add age_arr into parameters object
%%%%add the forth output of this function [yini age_arr S0_imm initS] = make_ics_naive
create the function initial_prev_Xu_uniform. It will be called in main_MCMC

23012015
I should find a time to rewrite the document spec for the whole process.
Then I make a clean version without redundant codes.

16012015
Add visualization tools.
figure2_posterior to plot sera distribution.
table2_goodnessfit to show p value using chi square test.

01122014
I create a priorpdf function to calculate the pdf with lb (lower bound) and ub. Not testing yet. For uniform, it doesn't need.
E:\working\Projects.IC\Projects\isl\mat\Misltr\isltr-1.3\lib\model

10112014
Use the product of prob and titres array to calculate likelihood. Becomes faster.

05112014
Succesfully incorporating R compartment.
add Tga = [4.3 3.3 3.3 3.3] in matlab and java package

04112014
Design a function to plot the distribution of newly infected individual.
My hypothesis is that current age group1, most of infected are from naive.
Antibody dependent boosting rate.
Define a new function in java which contains R individuals.
%ydot = meser.getStatesDeriv();
ydot = meser.getStatesSIRSDeriv();
retrieve_histogram->
gen_strain_titres->
titremat(i,l) = titremat(i,l) + y(i,pars.arrSlu(a,l,m,n)) +  "y(i,pars.arrRlu(a,l,m,n))";

also check gen_strain_titres.m 

02112014
change pa.maxi from 9 to 10.
Plot proportion changes of accumulated incidences of different age groups as K = 1, 2 and 3.
main/plot/plot_histogram_hk 
Histogram -> plot T2 not T3 anymore. T3 has 2nd wave, hard to interpret now!

DefineLastSamlingday
Otherwise sampling too many data
 Yt = Yt(find(sampletime < SamplingLastDay));

01112014
change generation time to be 2.9 days
change first case date 11/06/2009
change par.maxi = 8. Lots of functions depend on this parameter:
getNegLLHAge
estimatelikelihood:
	 if pa.mini == 0
           LLH = calculateLogLikelihood(obs_prob,obs+1); %change to inline function?? 24 Jul 2014

make_ics_fromtitres_byage:
	if pars.mint == 0
          data_bar = accumarray(Abl(find(age>=pars.ages(a,1) & age<pars.ages(a,2)))+1,1);

getNegLLHAgejava:
	Abl(find(Abl>par.maxt)) = par.maxt; %substitute Ab level >8 by 8;set max antibody level=8

getNegLLHAge:
	Abl(find(Abl>par.maxt)) = par.maxt; %substitute Ab level >8 by 8;set max antibody level=8, initial titres = 0

cal_NGM_bybeta(beta,Ab,pars):
 	Abl(find(Abl>pars.maxt)) = pars.maxt;

bugs for calculating R0:
getMOF_byS( pars,y )
cont = [pars.ContFrac1, pars.ContFrac2, pars.ContFrac3, pars.ContFrac4];
No need to time cont(a) when calculate this matFOI_S becase matM is alread updatd by cont.
matFOI_byS(X,a,b,i,j,k) = beta*matM(a,b)*cont(a)*arrf(b,i,j,k);

Still need to check calR0_bypar(theta_beta,par). Looks like Rt is on for K=3.
Make sure which sampling time we are using.

31102014
#Check result. not very good.
#change make_ics_fromtitres_byage:
put pop = [16.42 30.29 39.4 13.2]*pars.N into parameter

#desity dependent simulation. Besure the seed should be divided by totalN.

#change InitParameters:
pa.ages = [0 18; 19 39;...] -> [0 19; 20 39;...] check demographic ratio? 

#pass time_obs to estimatelikelihood
Because now titres starts from 0, I have to change calculateLogLikelihood.

#need to analyze multiple yt for the same day then I can derive factor for multinomial.

%%plot the dynamics (not done)

#change 
Yout = retrieve_histogram(yfinal, pars, 1, 1, agegroup);
Yini = retrieve_histogram(yini, pars, 1, 1, agegroup);
check line27 in plot_dynamics_bypar

30102014
change getNegLLHAgejava	estimate Likelihood by exact time
change main_produce_bytime	
change make_ics_naive -> save TitresTableTotal



release islt-1.0
sample model output and get likelihood of observed data:
1. get observed data sampling date
2. produce model output at each sampling times
3. calculate likelihood
4. sum all the calculate likelihood
####Beaware
####Previously Antibody titres stored in titres.mat are from 1-9. Now I change to 0-8 to be consistent.
####However isl3.3 still uses titres from 1-9.

%determine the sero prevalence, make sure the number of initial susceptible are correct.


20140714 modify make_ics_fromtitres to make_ics_fromtitres_byage
pass age to the function.

modify this code: make_ics_fromtitres_byage

-----------release 2.0--02/07/2014-----------
20140707
produce likelihood_2params_20140707.mat in folder 20140703 for single boosting parameter.
The overall shape is better but the max likelihood becomes slightly lower.


20140706
[multi_p multi_p_byage] = get_titres_prob
should use multi_p_byage
I should return both with age groups and without age groups.

20140704
Change main_estimatelikelihood_hk. Calculate likelihood by age each time.
Working on ln46-47.
setParameters 
InitParameters pa.ages = [0 6; 6 20; 20 65; 65 100];
Still debugging. Check ln24 from estimatelikelihood(pa,abl_obs,abl_ini)

20140703
Check main_producetitres_hk. Need to include age information into Antibody titres observed data. Now it saves both Abl and age om Antibody structure.

20140702
Put optim package into lib folder.
add new function get_popweights_4_hk_2013 into make_ics_fromtitres.m. Beaware whether I need to add this function in make_ics.m and make_ics_naive.m.


To do:
1. Put optim package into main folder.
2. Check whether max likelihood will be better than previous model.
3. Use HK population data. Redo likelihood estimation. 
4. Incorporate age structure in likelihood calculation. Calculate likelihood for single immune boosting.
5. Incorporate age dependent immune boosting rates. Calculate likelihood.


-----------release 1.6--27/06/2014-----------

(1)
Plot_dynamics by age group.

(2)
Line40-41 in calculate_R0.m

%2)initial condition from previous season
[yini age_arr] = make_ics_fromtitres( pars, pars.arrSlu, pars.arrIlu, pars.arrCIlu, Antibody(k-1).Abl);

Should change k-1 -> 1 because in the main function, I use first collection sampling time as initial condition. 
Then it would give correct beta-R0 calculation.

isl-1.5

20140527
update age mixing matrix again. use the correct row and column. rerun NGM calculating for R0.
when beta is 0.96, something is going wrong for R0, too low. ignore this first but keep in mind.

20140424
Update 
make_g_simple with poisson distribution with cutoff
make_h_simple keep same or linearly decrease
result: looks like disease dynamics for plot_dynamics( 1.25, 4, 0 ) is fine


20140423
To do:
1. After meeting with Steven, use contact data from China and try both naive poisson and the semi-mechanistic model for boosting to
measure likelihood.
2. Plot a 2D map to show boosting matrix.

20140414
Chech age structures in getMOF
plot_line.m set susceptible to be titres <1:40
            set recovered to be titres >= 1:40


-----------release 1.3-----------
20140402
to do:
remove all the functions (not main not plot) to lib folder.

20140401
to do:
In titres.mat, Antibody.sampleize is wrong. Need to store ID in Antibody.Abl. (done)

20140326
Done: make a deterministic version of plot_infecteds_distribution_deter.m.

20140321
to do:
Try to use a fix time point. Days are T3-T2 ~365d and turn off the immune waning rate now.
Make sure the sample size and sampling time are correctly stored.

20140320
to do:
Generate total_infecteds in plot_line.m and determine the sample_time when total_infecteds is lower than the threshold. (d)
For calculating likelihood, also need to determine the sample_time.

did: 
Modify make_g_simple() and make_gtable_simple() If the target boosting level is larger than max level, used max level.
Modify main_dynamics: use setParameters to change the parameters values. pars.R0 = 2.3-> pars = setParameters(pars,'R0',2.3);
Modify main_dynamics: to determine the sample_time based on the threshold (d).
Change the range for simulation instimatelikelihood_hk from 1 to 365*3.

20140319
did:
Modify estimatelikelihood_hk.m. Add LLH_Map object to show Meshgrid later for R0 and Antibody Boosting. Save output to
20140317/herdimmunity_hk/likelihood_2params.mat



20140318
to do:
a. Sample size in Antibody is 1. Should be the total number of samples.
b. Read initial condition from titres.mat
c. Create a function to update the parameter values. Now work on antibody boosting. Make sure what will happen if boosting larger than 4.

did:
Create the function make_ics_fromtitres.m. Setup the initial using the previous antibody titres levels. (b)
Create the funciton estimatelikelihood_hk.m. Update R0 and AbB in this funciton.
